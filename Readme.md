# Retro Touch Type

A HTML5 + JS reproduction of a game I used to learn to touch type on an x086 in the mid 80s.

Dedicated to my beautiful kids Kayla, Taj & Felix.

_Note:_ For me this game works best in Google Chrome, then Firefox, it is now working in Safari and IE 11 though IE won't play sound.

And took inspiration from the Udemy course "How to Program Games: Tile Classics in JS for HTML5 Canvas" by Chris DeLeon
